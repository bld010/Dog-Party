# Dog Party

This project provided two images of compositions for students to recreate using HTML and CSS -- The catch is that only one HTML document is used for both compositions. The input/button also uses JavaScript to replace "Some Dogs" with user input. 

## Skills Acquired

This project focused on semantic naming in HTML, and clean, streamlined CSS. Focusing on clear, descriptive HTML tags and class names allowed for easier CSS styling in the both comp. 

Media queries are used to maintain readability after resizing the page. I used them only in the first comp to help reorganize the article columns. In the second comp, I focused on relative positioning to maintain readability upon resizing.
